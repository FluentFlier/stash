Stash: Your AI Personal Secretary
One tap. Remembers forever.

The Problem
You save 50+ things a week - articles, videos, recipes, meeting notes, gift ideas. Where do they go?
Links rot in Pocket (never opened)
Screenshots pile up (never organized)
Calendar events are manual data entry
Reminders say "review this" with zero context
You can't remember what you saved last week, let alone last month
You don't have a second brain. You have digital hoarding.

The Solution
Stash lives in your phone's share sheet. One tap from ANY app - Safari, Twitter, YouTube, Messages, Photos - and it:
 ✅ Understands what you want ("Read later", "Send to Mom", "Research for blog post")
 ✅ Adds events to Google Calendar automatically
 ✅ Sets contextual reminders ("Review this before Monday's meeting")
 ✅ Remembers EVERYTHING you've ever saved
 ✅ Retrieves it instantly when you need it
Plus: Chat with Stash anytime via messages. Ask "what did I save about Rust?" or "remind me what I wanted to cook this weekend" - it knows.

How It Works
Example 1: Stash from Anywhere
Scrolling Twitter, see Rust tutorial thread
Tap Share → Stash → say "Learn this for my project, remind me Saturday"
✨ Auto-tagged "programming/Rust", reminder set, added to "project learning" collection
Saturday morning: notification with the thread + related resources you saved before
Example 2: Calendar Without Thinking
Friend texts: "Coffee next Tuesday 3pm at Blue Bottle?"
Share to Stash → it extracts the event
✨ Added to Google Calendar with location, 30min reminder set
Example 3: Chat with Your Memory
Week later, open Stash and ask: "What was that Rust thing I saved?"
✨ Instant retrieval with summaries, grouped by theme, ready to review
Or text Stash directly: "Show me everything about my thesis research"

Why This Wins
Unlike Notion: You don't organize anything. It's automatic.
 Unlike Todoist: It understands context, not just due dates.
 Unlike Pocket: It actually surfaces what you saved when you need it.
 Unlike ChatGPT: It remembers everything across all conversations.
We're not another app you have to remember to use. We're built into the share sheet - the button you already tap 20+ times a day. And you can chat with us anytime.

The Tech
Supermemory (YC-backed) for persistent AI memory - sub-400ms retrieval
Share sheet integration - iOS/Android native
GPT-4 for intent understanding
Google Calendar API for automatic event creation
Deepgram for voice input and audio analysis
React Native for cross-platform mobile

Building at NexHacks 2026
When: January 17-18, 2026 at Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh
 Competing in:
Main Track: Dev Tools ($2,000 prize)
DevSwarm sponsor track ($1,000 + interview opportunities)
LeanMCP sponsor track ($500 + guaranteed interviews)
Why we'll win: OS-level integration that nobody else has. Memory that actually works. Real problem that everyone feels.

What I Need
Looking for co-founders who can:
iOS/Android dev - share extensions, native integration
Backend/AI - LLM orchestration, Supermemory integration
Design - make the share sheet + chat UX feel magical
Also open to building the MVP solo this weekend and recruiting after.

TL;DR: Notion + Todoist + Pocket + ChatGPT = ONE app called Stash. Capture from anywhere. Chat with your memory. Remember everything. Retrieve instantly.
This is the second brain that actually works.

DM me if you:
Save 20+ links/week and never read them
Have 500+ unread Pocket articles
Constantly forget what you saved where

PROJECT: STASH (working name)
Core Concept:
AI personal secretary that lives in your phone's share sheet. Captures everything you save (links, notes, voice memos, images) with intelligent understanding of your intent, persistent memory across all interactions, and proactive reminders/actions.
Problem:
People save 50+ items per week (articles, videos, recipes, ideas)
Pocket: 500+ unread articles, never opened
Notes app: scattered, no organization
Screenshots: lost in camera roll
Calendar: manual data entry
Reminders: vague, no context
ChatGPT/Claude: forgets everything after conversation ends
Core insight: You don't have a second brain. You have digital hoarding.
Solution:
One-tap capture from ANY app via share sheet → AI understands intent → Auto-organizes + sets reminders + adds to calendar + remembers forever → Retrieves when you need it.
Key Features (MVP):
Universal Capture - Share sheet integration (iOS/Android)
Intent Understanding - "Read later", "Send to Mom", "Research for thesis"
Smart Actions:
Auto-add to Google Calendar
Set contextual reminders
Extract link metadata
Auto-tag and categorize
Persistent Memory - Supermemory integration (semantic search, <400ms retrieval)
Chat Interface - "What did I save about Rust last week?"
Voice Input - Speak your intent instead of typing
Technical Stack:
Mobile:
React Native (cross-platform)
Share extension libraries
Firebase Auth
Backend:
Node.js + Express
Supermemory Memory Router (API proxy for GPT-4)
Firebase Cloud Messaging (notifications)
Bull Queue + Redis (job scheduling)
APIs:
Supermemory API (persistent memory layer)
GPT-4 Turbo via Supermemory Router
Google Calendar API
Microlink API (link metadata)
ElevenLabs (voice transcription/TTS)
Infrastructure:
Vercel (backend hosting)
Railway/Render (Redis)
Expo (React Native deployment)
Unfair Advantages:
Supermemory Partnership


YC-backed ($2.6M seed, founded by ex-Cloudflare engineer)
Sub-400ms semantic retrieval
1M tokens/month free tier
Automatic memory injection (one line of code)
OS-Level Integration


Share sheet = universal access
